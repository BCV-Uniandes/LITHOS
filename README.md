# LITHOS: Large-scale Imaging and Thin Section Optical-polarization Set for Automated Petrography
LITHOS Official Benchmark Repository

LITHOS is the largest publicly available dataset and benchmark for automated petrography, containing over 211,000 high-resolution polarized light image patches and 105,000 expert-annotated mineral grains across 25 categories. This repository provides the dataset, code, and pretrained models, including a dual-encoder transformer baseline that leverages multiple polarization modalities for improved mineral classification. LITHOS aims to accelerate research and reproducibility in automated mineralogical analysis from thin section images.
